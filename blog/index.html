  </a>
  <div class="details">Posted by Hiram Chirino on Thursday, September 20, 2012</div>
<p><a href="http://fusesource.com">FuseSource</a> is pleased to announce the availability of
HawtDispatch 1.12.</p>

<p>HawtDispatch is a small ( less than 100k ) thread pooling and NIO event
notification framework API modeled after the <code>libdispatch</code> API that Apple
created to power the Grand Central Dispatch (GCD) technology in OS X. It
allows you to easily develop multi-threaded applications without having to
deal with the problems that traditionally plague multi-threaded application
development.</p>

<p><strong>HawtDispatch 1.12 Highlights</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Custom dispatch sources will now return null after the event has been received to avoid accidentally double processing events.</li>
<li>Make sure we only return false from the offer method when the transport is also full()</li>
<li>Add a closeOnCancel option to disable closing the socket when the transport is stopped.</li>
<li>Rename the SecuredTransport interface to SecuredSession and now both the SSLProtocolCodec and SslTransport implement it.</li>
<li>You can now handle SSL/TLS encoding/decoding via a wrapping protocol codec.  ProtocolCodec and Transport interfaces needs a couple of adjustments to properly support the co</li>
<li>Better handling of getting the local host address.</li>
<li>Protocol codec decoding optimizations.</li>
<li>Move all the connect logic into the start method.</li>
<li>Do host name resolutions on a blocking executor to avoid stalling the hawtdispatch threads.</li>
<li>Resize the read buffer after reading from the channel if to avoid to avoid holding on to large buffers.</li>
<li>Support changing the socket send/recv buffer size on started transports and servers.</li>
<li>Do at least a non blocking select when we notice that another thread requested the NIO manager wakeup.  This should allow us to pickup any new IO events that have occurred</li>
<li>Dropped the continuations example, added a SSL transport client example</li>
</ul>
